# ProgrammingBasics
Projects and assignments, as well as exam tasks, part of the Programming Fundamentals course. 
The course is for Beginners with no prior experience in programming. 
The homework projects are numbered according to the lecture number in witch they were studied.
The problems are simple and basic. Their aim was to intruduse fundamental concepts in programming.
Even though it's good practice to write summerised explanations about what the code does, it was not part of the cource.
